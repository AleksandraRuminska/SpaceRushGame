# SpaceRushGame

A simple single-player game created during the course on 3D Unity Development on Udemy taught by members of GameDev.tv.

In this game player controls the spaceship, flying it through the valleys and mountains of a distant unknown planet, trying to defend it from the enemy ships coming its way.
The aim is to elimiinate as many enemy spaceships as possible, without dying. The player is advised by the Admiral who pops out on the screen troughout the game with warnings or with praise for a job well done.

The ship follows it's own path, but the player may control it by:
* Arrow Up - tipping the ship up
* Arrow Down - moving the ship down; diving
* Arrow left - moving slighlty to the left side of the screen
* Arrow right - moving slighlty to the right side of the screen
* Mouse right button - shooting lasers
